is transfer learning/pretrainng able to be applied here?

TODO
- add random crops (support for multiple patches per image) to dataset
- add running avg loss
- deal with weird noise issue in images, ruining model on some examples

Models
- SRCNN - basic model, used to test dataset
- some other ConvNet for SR
- SRGAN?
- PConv - augment with attention?
- PixelSNAIL but tiny?
- Image Transformer but tiny

Tuning
- learning rate, learning schedule
- layer parameters
- conv first, attention alter
- residual connections

Metrics
- consistency, just l2 between LR and model output (downscaled)
- PSNR, SSIM, not very important, but nice to have anyway
- need to use new loss function for training, MSE not gonna be good for PConv
- if probabilistic model, then NLL
- measure efficiency, theres probably a library for it
- MOS using Mechanical Turk???
