is transfer learning/pretrainng able to be applied here?

TODO
Finish writing dataset/dataloader
- cache images as hdf5 bc PNG conversion is slow
- will adapt when changing resolution, will cache new images
- multiple random crops per picture

Models
- SRCNN - basic model, used to test dataset
- some other ConvNet for SR
- SRGAN?
- PConv -
- PixelSNAIL but tiny?
- Image Transformer but tiny

Tuning
- learning rate, learning schedule
- layer parameters
- conv first, attention alter
- residual connections

Metrics
- consistency, just l2 between LR and model output (downscaled)
- PSNR, SSIM, not very important, but nice to have anyway
- if probabilistic model, then NLL
- measure efficiency, theres probably a library for it
